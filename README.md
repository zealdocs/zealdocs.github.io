# zealdocs.github.io
https://zealdocs.org/: web documentation for [Zeal, an offline documentation browser][zeal].

## Development
To build this static site, you need the following dependencies:
- `jekyll` (`v3.1.6` from Ubuntu 18.04 works correctly)

To perform a one-off build, run:
```sh
jekyll build
```

To build any time a source code file changes and locally host the results at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`, run:
```sh
jekyll serve
```

For more information on jekyll usage, see [the official jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).
